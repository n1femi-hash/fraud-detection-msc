### 🧹 `data_cleaning.py` — Dataset Preprocessing

This script prepares the raw Kaggle dataset for machine learning by applying feature engineering, categorizing continuous variables, and reducing dimensionality. It produces a cleaned and enriched dataset optimized for fraud classification.

#### 🧰 Key Functionalities

1. **File Loading**

   * Loads `fraudTrain.csv` and `fraudTest.csv` from the `assets/` directory.
   * Loads auxiliary mappings from:

     * `job_sector.json` — for job-to-sector mapping
     * `age_group.json` — for custom age group classification

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * `extract_age`: Calculates age from the `dob` column.
   * `group_age`: Buckets ages into named age groups (e.g., Youth, Adult, Senior).
   * `group_amt`: Categorizes transaction amount magnitude (units, tens, hundreds+).
   * `set_job_sector`: Maps job titles to predefined sectors.
   * `extract_date`: Extracts transaction month and hour from the timestamp.
   * `get_time_of_day`: Converts transaction hour to time-of-day buckets (Morning, Evening, etc.).
   * `get_season`: Classifies month into seasonal categories (Winter, Spring, etc.).
   * `calculate_distance`: Computes geospatial distance between user and merchant via Haversine formula.
   * `group_distance`: Assigns distance into one of three buckets: `Nearest`, `Near`, `Far`.
   * `group_population`: Groups `city_pop` into three tiers: `Few`, `Average`, `Populous`.

3. **Column Cleanup**

   * Drops redundant, high-cardinality, or irrelevant fields such as:

     * `cc_num`, `dob`, `trans_num`, `street`, `city`, `merchant`, `lat`, `long`, `zip`, etc.

4. **Final Output**

   * Saves cleaned datasets as:

     * `assets/cleaned_fraud_train.csv`
     * `assets/cleaned_fraud_test.csv`

#### 💡 Usage

1. Ensure the following files are available:

   * `assets/fraudTrain.csv`
   * `assets/fraudTest.csv`
   * `misc/job_sector.json`
   * `misc/age_group.json`

2. Run the script with:

```bash
python src/data_cleaning.py
```

This will generate cleaned and feature-rich datasets in the `assets/` folder, ready for augmentation or modeling.

---

### 🧼 `data_preprocessing.py` — Balancing & One-Hot Encoding

This script performs **two key preprocessing steps** to prepare the dataset for machine learning models:

1. **Class Balancing via Downsampling**
2. **Vectorization via One-Hot Encoding**

It operates on the cleaned datasets and generates a final, fully encoded and class-balanced output for training and testing.

---

#### 🧠 Why This Step Matters

* The dataset is **highly imbalanced**, with far more non-fraud than fraud transactions.
* Many columns are **categorical**, requiring transformation into numeric vectors via **one-hot encoding**.
* Machine learning models like logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks require **numerically encoded** and **balanced** input.

---

#### ⚙️ What the Script Does

1. **Load Datasets**
   Reads the cleaned datasets:

   * `cleaned_fraud_train.csv`
   * `cleaned_fraud_test.csv`

2. **Display Before Processing**
   Prints class distribution (`is_fraud`) and previews first few rows of both datasets.

3. **Class Balancing via Downsampling**

   * Finds the smallest class count (`is_fraud == 1` or `0`)
   * Samples that same number of rows from both classes
   * Ensures the resulting dataset has a **50:50** fraud-to-non-fraud ratio

4. **Vectorization via One-Hot Encoding**

   * Applies `pd.get_dummies()` to **every column except `is_fraud`**
   * Avoids feature name conflicts using prefixes
   * Concatenates one-hot vectors into the dataframe

5. **Column Alignment**

   * Ensures both train and test sets have the **same columns** (even if some categories exist in only one set)
   * Fills missing columns with `0.0` as default

6. **Display After Processing**

   * Prints balanced class counts
   * Previews the one-hot encoded data

7. **Final Output**

   * Saves final preprocessed files as:

     * `preprocessed_fraud_train.csv`
     * `preprocessed_fraud_test.csv`

| `category_gas_transport`      | One-hot vector from original categorical fields |
| `job_sector_Information Tech` | Sector one-hot encoded                          |
| `time_of_day_Morning`         | Time of day encoding                            |
| `season_Summer`               | Seasonal encoding                               |
| `city_pop_group_Populous`     | Population group encoding                       |
| `trans_distance_group_Far`    | Distance group encoding                         |

#### 💡 Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

Make sure the cleaned datasets exist in the following paths:

```
assets/cleaned_fraud_train.csv
assets/cleaned_fraud_test.csv
```

This will generate:

```
assets/preprocessed_fraud_train.csv
assets/preprocessed_fraud_test.csv
```

These final datasets are ready to be passed into your training pipeline.

### ⚠️ Note on Data Augmentation

Data augmentation was intentionally excluded from this project.

Initial attempts at synthetic data generation—whether by sampling from feature distributions or using techniques like SMOTE—consistently introduced excessive **noise** and **overfitting**, especially due to the presence of high-cardinality and categorical fields such as `job_sector`, `merchant`, and `category`.

Rather than risk reduced generalization and misleading performance metrics, the pipeline relies on real, cleaned data combined with class balancing via **downsampling**, resulting in a more stable and trustworthy training process.

### 🔐 TAME Analysis in Cybersecurity Context

The implementation aligns with the **TAME framework** commonly used in cybersecurity threat modeling. TAME stands for **Tactics, Attack Vectors, Motivations, and Execution**, and is used to understand adversarial behavior in digital systems, including financial fraud.

| **TAME Component** | **Application in This Project**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tactics**        | The system extracts behavioral patterns associated with fraud, such as unusual transaction times (`time_of_day`), geographically distant merchant locations (`trans_distance_group`), and seasonal timing (`season`). These features help represent the tactics often used by fraudulent actors. |
| **Attack Vectors** | While specific exploitation methods are not directly modeled, the dataset inherently captures the outcomes of attack vectors such as identity theft, stolen credentials, or POS manipulation. The model detects fraud by learning from these outcomes.                                           |
| **Motivations**    | The model operates under the assumption of financially motivated fraud. Features such as transaction amount, merchant category, and job sector are indicative of attempts to extract monetary gain.                                                                                              |
| **Execution**      | Execution strategies are captured through metadata, including timing (`trans_hour`), location (`trans_distance`), and context (`category`, `merchant`). These details contribute to profiling the execution stage of fraudulent activity.                                                        |

This framework provides a structured lens through which the machine learning pipeline can be contextualized within broader cybersecurity practices, particularly in the detection and analysis of financial fraud.
